# title: "About me"
---

I am a PhD student at the University of Queensland, affiliated with [EQUS](https://equs.org/users/evan-gale). I study theoretical physics,
with interests in relativistic quantum mechanics, quantum field theory and the foundations of physics.

Currently, I am studying problems with localisation in the atom-light interaction and Unruh-DeWitt detector model. More specifically,
I am looking at the physical consequences of the localisation scheme employed by modelling the atom-detector's quantised centre of mass,
corresponding to different definitions of the associated position operator.

Additionally, I am also currently investigating the properties of a novel class minimum uncertainty states,
which minimise the uncertainty between the position-velocity quadratures rather than the usual position-momentum quadratures in phase space.
